👀 I’m interested in all things tech and coding, from crafting elegant web/device applications to diving into the 
intricacies of Java and JavaScript, and staying up-to-date with industry trends.

🌱 I’m currently learning and honing my skills in Full Stack development and Android,focusing on Kotlin, JavaScript, PHP,
Java, and Spring Boot, always eager to grow and deliver better solutions.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative and meaningful projects that make a positive impact, 
whether it's creating user-friendly interfaces, developing robust backends, or anything in between.

🌊 When not coding, you'll find me at the beach, enjoying serene waves 🏖️, 
or hiking through nature trails, embracing the beauty of the outdoors 🚶‍♂️, 
and staying active in fitness 💪🏋️‍♂️, and unwinding with favorite movies 🍿🎬.
